            Welcome to <strong>Stick It</strong>, a site to keep track of your game dev logs.
            <br/><br/>
            You can write, edit and store sticky notes, add reference images and best of all, it's all on the web so you can't spill coffee on them!
            <br/><br/>
            This site was created by <strong>Katherine Gomez</strong> for the Unit 2 Project at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp.
            It is a full CRUD app and it's built with RESTful conventions using Javascript, EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, CSS and Bulma for styling.
            <br/><br/>
            You can take a look at the full code to create this app by clicking here.
